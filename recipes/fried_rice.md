# Fried Rice

## Ingredients
* Momofuku Tingly Seasoned Salt (Honestly could sub Sichuan Pepper, that's the main bit I like) [Link](https://shop.momofuku.com/products/tingly-seasoned-salt)
* Golden mountain Tuong Gia Vi [Amazon Link](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CQ34CQ26)
* Healthy Boy Thai Black Soy Sauce [Amazon Link](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B089RQQD2Z)
* Rice, I generally use Jasmine, but any long/medium grained should be fine, Ideally, leftover rice is best as it's dried out a little.
* Eggs, as many/few as you like (I tend to like it egg heavy.)
* Meat, whatever you've got around, or none at all. (Seriously anything, often whatever leftover meat we have around.)
* Veg, Whatever you got around, or none at all.  (Often use left over roasted veg, such as: brussel sprouts, carrots, parsnips, corn, etc)
* Oil/Butter.


## Instructions

*  Ideally using a cast iron skillet or wok, melt some butter and add your rice.  Toast the rice for a little while, until you get some color on the rice.  Start cranking up the heat to high.
* Once the rice is starting to get a little heat/color/fried-ness to it.... add in the seasoning.  Season to taste, this takes time to experiment with, I typically go in with a heavy dose of the golden mountain soy sauce, much lighter with the black soy sauce (this adds sweetness to round flavor out, you don't need a ton), and then of course the tingly component.
* After the seasoning is mixed into the rice, I then shift the rice to one side of the skillet and start cracking eggs in the other side.  Heat is still on high typically here.  Start to scramble the eggs, add a little soy sauce directly to the eggs while they cook.
* Once the eggs are cooked, mixed them into the rice.
* Then mix in your veg and meat.
* Taste and decide if you need to add any more seasoning, then combine and heat to finish.
* Serve and Enjoy!
